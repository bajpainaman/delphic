## The Oracle Solution That Bridges Web2 and Web3

![Delphic Protocol Logo](https://placeholder.com/logo)

## What is Delphic?

Delphic Protocol is a revolutionary oracle solution that allows anyone to bring **any API data on-chain** through a secure, verifiable, and customizable oracle network built on Avalanche.

Unlike traditional oracle networks that limit users to pre-selected data streams, Delphic empowers developers and businesses to use their existing APIs directly with blockchain applications, creating a true bridge between Web2 and Web3.

## The Problem We're Solving

Current oracle solutions force developers to:
- Choose from limited pre-selected data feeds
- Rebuild their existing applications around oracle limitations
- Sacrifice customization and flexibility

This creates a massive barrier preventing Web2 companies from entering the blockchain space.

## Our Vision

Delphic Protocol makes blockchain technology accessible to all businesses by allowing them to seamlessly connect their existing APIs to the decentralized world. We're building the missing infrastructure layer that will accelerate mainstream blockchain adoption.

## Why Avalanche?

We've chosen to build Delphic on Avalanche (AVAX) for several key reasons:
- **Speed & Scalability**: AVAX's high throughput enables real-time data feeds
- **EVM Compatibility**: Seamless integration with existing Ethereum smart contracts
- **Low Fees**: Cost-effective oracle operations for frequent updates
- **Subnets**: Potential for custom oracle subnets with specific security properties
- **Growing Ecosystem**: Strategic positioning in one of blockchain's fastest-growing ecosystems

## How Delphic Works

1. **Request**: Users specify their API endpoint, encrypted API key, parameters, and update frequency through our intuitive interface
2. **Processing**: Oracle nodes fetch data using Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), ensuring API keys remain secure
3. **Verification**: Multiple nodes validate the data, creating a cryptographic proof of authenticity
4. **Delivery**: The verified data is stored on-chain with a reference to the complete response
5. **Consumption**: Smart contracts can directly access and utilize the verified API data

## Key Features

- **100% Custom Oracle Setup**: Use any API endpoint with any parameters
- **API Key Protection**: Secure key management through TEE technology
- **Flexible Update Frequency**: From one-time calls to regular updates
- **Verifiable Responses**: Cryptographic proofs ensure data integrity
- **Stake-Based Security**: Oracles stake AVAX tokens, creating economic security
- **Dispute Resolution**: Built-in mechanisms to handle inaccurate data

## Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation (Q2 2024)
- Core smart contract development on AVAX
- Basic TEE implementation for API key security
- Single-node proof of concept

### Phase 2: Decentralization (Q3 2024)
