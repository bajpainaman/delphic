## What is Delphic?

Delphic Protocol is a revolutionary oracle solution that allows anyone to bring **any API data on-chain** through a secure, verifiable, and customizable oracle network.

Unlike traditional oracle networks that limit users to pre-selected data streams, Delphic empowers developers and businesses to use their existing APIs directly with blockchain applications, creating a true bridge between Web2 and Web3.

## The Problem We're Solving

Current oracle solutions force developers to:
- Choose from limited pre-selected data feeds
- Rebuild their existing applications around oracle limitations
- Sacrifice customization and flexibility

This creates a massive barrier preventing Web2 companies from entering the blockchain space.

## Our Vision

Delphic Protocol makes blockchain technology accessible to all businesses by allowing them to seamlessly connect their existing APIs to the decentralized world. We're building the missing infrastructure layer that will accelerate mainstream blockchain adoption.

## Why Delphic?

- **Universal API Support**: Connect any API endpoint to any blockchain
- **Secure Key Management**: Your API keys remain protected through advanced TEE technology
- **Customizable Data Feeds**: Set your own update frequency and parameters
- **Verifiable Execution**: Cryptographic proofs ensure transparency and correctness
- **Cost-Effective**: Pay only for the data you need, when you need it

## How Delphic Works

1. **Request**: Users specify their API endpoint, encrypted API key, parameters, and update frequency through our intuitive interface
2. **Processing**: Oracle nodes fetch data using Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), ensuring API keys remain secure
3. **Verification**: Multiple nodes validate the data, creating a cryptographic proof of authenticity
4. **Delivery**: The verified data is stored on-chain with a reference to the complete response
5. **Consumption**: Smart contracts can directly access and utilize the verified API data

## Key Features

- **100% Custom Oracle Setup**: Use any API endpoint with any parameters
- **API Key Protection**: Secure key management through TEE technology
- **Flexible Update Frequency**: From one-time calls to regular updates
- **Verifiable Responses**: Cryptographic proofs ensure data integrity
- **Stake-Based Security**: Oracles stake native tokens, creating economic security
- **Dispute Resolution**: Built-in mechanisms to handle inaccurate data

## Development Roadmap
